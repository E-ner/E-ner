## 💻 Backend Developer | 🧠 Problem Solver | 🌍 Passionate about Impact

I'm a self-taught developer who loves building **scalable backend systems** and meaningful products. I specialize in:

- 🟩 **Node.js, NestJS, Express**
- ⚡ **Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS**
- 📦 REST APIs & Microservices
- 🧪 Database Design (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MSQL)
- 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- 🧑‍🏫 I love sharing what I know and helping people avoid misinformation.

I'm currently working on real-world micro backend projects and learning how to **turn ideas into useful tools** for others. I believe in building to learn and sharing to grow.
